## About Omnifood

We are a technology company with a major focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. Our mission is to make healthy eating easy and accessible for everyone, even those with the busiest schedules. Using an AI-centric approach, our app allows users to select their dietary preferences, and our AI algorithm generates a personalized weekly meal plan. Partnering with local restaurants and cooks, we prepare and deliver these meals to your door in selected cities. This service is available through a monthly subscription, with options for one or two meals per day.
